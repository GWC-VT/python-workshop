# this code prints a little triangle of "o"s!

for x in range(5):
    print("o" * x)


# suggestions

# run it in a few different sizes by changing 5 to a different number
# make a variable called size, set it so something, and feed that into range() instead of 5
# change it to take user input using size = input()
